In summary, this experience:
PwC Switzerland Digital Intelligence Job Simulation on Forage 
 * Completed a job simulation involving data analysis and modeling for the
   Digital Intelligence team.
 * Built Python classification models, analyzed feature importance, and created
   visual representations.
 * Developed a valuation document, analyzed historical data, forecasted cash
   flows, and determined portfolio present value.
 * Collaborated on a client's data strategy proposal, analyzed medical data for
   adverse effects, compared medications, and suggested further investigations

   ## Task 2
   * Use SkLearn to build a phone marketing algorithm predicts whether a certain person will subscribe to a term deposit or not.
   * Analyse the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
   * Dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing

   ## Task 3
   *  Predicting the future cash flows needed for the valuation of a portfolio consisting of merchant loans
   *  Take care you need to take this formula given below and not the one given in order to get the right answer: (formula for the repayment forecast)

   ## Task 4
   * Develop a data strategy, define data reports, and analyze data platform maturity.
  
   ## Task 5
   * Work on huge dataset - The US has a central database, hosted by the FDA. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a database that contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to FDA. The database is designed to support the FDAâ€™s post-marketing safety surveillance programme for drug and therapeutic biologic products.
   * Data preprocessing and bind all our dataset together.
   * Show the 10 most common adverse effects as they are reported in the FAERS database.
   * Compare tramal to another medication called lyrica that is also commonly used to treat neurological pain.
  
   ## Task 6
   * Derive the aggregate claims distribution over a 1-year time horizon. Based on this distribution, derive the expected annual aggregate claim costs as well as the 80% VaR (Value at Risk).
   * A Poisson distribution has been selected to model the claims frequency.
   *  A Pareto distribution has been selected for the claims severity.
   *  Remark:  shape parameter of the Pareto distribution based on a very limited data set, the standard value for property business of 2.5 is used. (Need to use 2.5 and not 1.5 as given in the assumption)
